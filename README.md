# Welcome to the course repo for **[Introduction to Machine Learning](https://introduction-to-machine-learning.netlify.app/)**!


The course is organized as a digital lecture, which should be as self-contained and enable self-study as much as possible. The major part of the material is provided as slide sets with lecture videos. We have also prepared interactive tutorials where you can answer multiple choice questions, and learn how to apply the covered methods in R on some short coding exercises. Our plan is to extend this self-study material over the next months and years.


The site itself is built on an amazing framework created by <a href='https://ines.io/'>Ines Montani</a>, originally created for her [spaCy course](https://course.spacy.io). The front-end is powered by
[Gatsby](http://gatsbyjs.org/) and [Reveal.js](https://revealjs.com) and the back-end code execution uses [Binder](https://mybinder.org).</p>

If you are interested in building a course on this framework, see Ines's starter repos for making courses in [Python](https://github.com/ines/course-starter-python) and [R](https://github.com/ines/course-starter-r), and her behind-the-scenes explanation of how the framework works at [the original course repo](https://github.com/ines/spacy-course#-faq).
